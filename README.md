# PHPStorm Colour Schemes
A collection of colour schemes for PHPStorm.

## Compatibility
These colour schemes were created in **PHPStorm 2017.3** as that's the editor I currently use, and I therefore can't guarantee compatibility with earlier versions of PHPStorm.

## Installation
From PHPStorm's Settings menu, go to `Editor`, then `Color Scheme`.

Click on the little settings icon next to the currently selected scheme.

Click on `Import Scheme`, and select the scheme file to import.

## Preview
You can preview the colour schemes on the [Preview page](https://robmeijer.github.io/phpstorm-colour-schemes).

## Colour Schemes
### DuoTone Dark Sea
This scheme is inspired by [simurai's DuoTone themes](http://simurai.com/projects/2016/01/01/duotone-themes), particularly the Dark Sea variant. There are DuoTone themes available for a number of editors, but I couldn't find one for PHPStorm, so I created one myself. It uses the same hues and shades, but doesn't tone down the punctuation quite as much.

It covers most file types, but I've paid particular attention to the types I use regularly, i.e. Php, Html, Css, Js, Yaml, and Json.
