# PhpStorm Colour Schemes
A collection of colour schemes for PhpStorm.

## Compatibility
These colour schemes were created in **PhpStorm 2017.2** as that's the editor I currently use, and I therefore can't guarantee compatibility with earlier versions of PhpStorm.

They cover most file types, but I've paid particular attention to the types I use regularly, i.e. Php, Html, Css, Js, Yaml, and Json.

## Installation
From PhpStorm's Settings menu, go to `Editor`, then `Color Scheme`.

Click on the little settings icon next to the currently selected scheme.

Click on `Import Scheme`, and select the scheme file to import.

## Preview
You can preview the colour schemes on the [Preview page](https://robmeijer.github.io/phpstorm-colour-schemes).

## Colour Schemes
### DuoTone Dark
These schemes are inspired by [simurai's DuoTone themes](http://simurai.com/projects/2016/01/01/duotone-themes). There are DuoTone themes available for a number of editors, but I couldn't find any for PhpStorm, so I created them myself.
They use the same hues and shades, but don't tone down the punctuation quite as much.
 
The following schemes are available:

- DuoTone Dark Sea
- DuoTone Dark Sky
- DuoTone Dark Space
